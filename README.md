# TLDR RSS

[![Update RSS](https://github.com/Bullrich/tldr-rss/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Bullrich/tldr-rss/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Recollection of [TLDR](https://tldr.tech) feeds. Unified into a single RSS feed.

Why?

Because `TLDR` feed publishes only one article per day, but inside this article it has many articles (around 12). I created this tool to access all of them from my RSS reader instead of having to go into each single one individually.
